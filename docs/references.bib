abstract = {The new edition of this bestselling book builds on the author{\textquoteright}s extensive administrative and consulting experience as well as scholarship on faculty rewards. It includes additional discussion of important foundational issues as well as practical forms and ideas gleaned from disciplinary groups and campuses throughout the nation.Like the first edition of Peer Review of Teaching, this new edition is offered in the hope that providing examples and suggestions will not reduce the important work of peer review to mere forms or rigid procedures, but will empower faculty to articulate criteria and standards, perform the reviews systematically and thoughtfully, and realize that engaging in peer review is an approachable and worthwhile professionaltask. Updated to reflect the emphasis on student learning as the ultimate goal of college teaching, it incorporates new ideas and references from the literature. The most notable change in this edition is a discussion of peer review within special contexts for teaching, such as clinics, studios, and practice settings. The turn to active engagement in learning has also led to increased use of problem-based learning, the case study method, and other approaches that traditional forms for peer review do not address. Similarly, the explosion of the use of instructional technology calls for an articulation of new approaches to evaluating web-basedinstruction.},

abstract = {Three definitions of "quality" have entered the quality assurance (QA) debate: quality as value for money, quality as fit for the purpose of the institution, quality as transforming. The first is pivotal for retrospective QA, which sees QA in terms of accountability, and conforming to externally imposed standards. The last two are pivotal for prospective QA, which sees QA as maintaining and enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the institution. In this paper, the reflective practitioner is taken as the model for prospective QA. Three stages are involved in institutional reflective practice: articulating an espoused theory of teaching, the quality model (QM); continually improving on current practice through quality enhancement (QE), in which staff development should play an important role; and making quality feasible (QF), by removing impediments to good teaching, which often arise through distorted priorities in institutional policy and procedures. These three stages, QM, QE, and QF, are essential ingredients in prospective QA.},

This inventory can aid instructors and departments in reflecting on their teaching. It has been tested with several hundred university instructors and courses from mathematics and four science disciplines. Most instructors complete the inventory in 10 min or less, and the results allow meaningful comparisons of the teaching used for the different courses and instructors within a department and across different departments. We also show how the inventory results can be used to gauge the extent of use of research-based teaching practices, and we illustrate this with the inventory results for five departments. These results show the high degree of discrimination provided by the inventory, as well as its effectiveness in tracking the increase in the use of research-based teaching practices.},
